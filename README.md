## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a secure web-based application developed as part of an academic course.
The main objective of the project is to design and implement a **secure authentication
and authorization system** by following modern web security best practices.

The system allows users to register, login, and access the application securely.
Special emphasis has been given to protecting the system against common security threats
such as brute-force attacks, SQL injection, session hijacking, and unauthorized access.
